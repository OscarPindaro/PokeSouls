 # Pokesouls

 if you dont have the sprites, clone it from git

 git clone https://github.com/OscarPindaro/SpriteCollab.git

 or

 git clone git@github.com:OscarPindaro/SpriteCollab.git


 Then, you need to convert the files AnimData.xml i think

 python Scripts/python/ConvertAnimData.py

 Lastly, you need a file that gives the corrispondesce between pokemon and numbers
